I am an assistant professor in the [Technologies in Practice](https://itu.dk/tip/) research group at the [IT University of Copenhagen](https://en.itu.dk/). In my research, I draw on theories from the field of science and technology studies. My research interests include surveillance, classification, politics of numbers, and the history of computing.

I have previously worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the [Department of Sociology](https://www.gold.ac.uk/sociology/) at [Goldsmiths, University of London](http://www.gold.ac.uk/), within the [European Research Council](https://erc.europa.eu/) funded research project [Peopling Europe: How data make a people (ARITHMUS)](http://arithmus.eu/).

I received my [PhD degree](http://su.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A643436) in 2013 from [Stockholm University](http://www.su.se/english/), [Department of Computer and Systems Sciences](http://dsv.su.se/en/). During my PhD, I was employed by the [Swedish Institute of Computer Science](https://www.sics.se/), and the Swedish Institute for Communicable Disease Control (now part of the [Public Health Agency of Sweden](https://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/smittskydd-beredskap/)).
